title: INNOQ Component Challenge

Up for a challenge? Implement the components in this pattern library in your
template language of choice. Is it powerful enough?

## Setup

```
npm i
npm start
```

Now you can see the pattern library at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Implementing this library

The component's styling is done via Bootstrap 5.0. So you'll need to include Bootstrap's CSS into your HTML:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>My cool demo pattern library in INSERT YOUR TEMPLATE LANGUAGE HERE</title>
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
		<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-BmbxuPwQa2lc/FVzBcNJ7UAyJxM6wuqIj61tLrc4wSX0szH/Ev+nYRRuWlolflfl" crossorigin="anonymous">
	</head>
	<body>
      ... 
	</body>
</html>
```
