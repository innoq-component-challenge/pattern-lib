title: Badge

The Badge is the most basic component. It is meant to demonstrate whitespace control which should absolutely not be any problem for any template language.

Parameters:
* content: "Hot"

```html
Hello World <span class="badge bg-danger">Hot</span>
```

**Whitespace needs to be controllable**
